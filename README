# Calendar Application (C)

A console-based calendar and task management application written in C.
This project was developed for a college-level programming course and
demonstrates structured programming, dynamic memory allocation, linked
lists, and file I/O.

## Features
- Add tasks to specific dates
- View a monthly calendar with task indicators
- View tasks for a specific day
- View all tasks for a month (compact view)
- View all tasks for a year (compact view)
- Delete tasks
- Search tasks by keyword
- Save and load tasks from a text file

## Technologies Used
- C (ANSI C)
- Dynamic memory allocation (malloc/free)
- Linked lists (doubly linked lists)
- File I/O
- Visual Studio (Windows)

## File Structure
- `main.c` (or `calendar.c`) – core application logic
- `calendar.h` – structures and function declarations
- `tasks.txt` – saved task data
- `CalendarAppTests` – Native unit tests

## How to Run
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio
2. Build the project
3. Run the executable
4. Follow the on-screen menu

## Notes
- Tasks are stored in a human-readable text file.
- Task IDs are automatically managed by the program.
- The project focuses on correctness and clarity over UI complexity.

## Team Responsibilities

### Farah Lariani (Core logic + editor)
- Implement core calendar data structures (years/months/days/tasks)
- Implement task operations:
  - Add task
  - Delete task (select date + task to delete)
  - Search tasks (keyword search)
- Implement file operations:
  - Save tasks to file
  - Load tasks from file
- Ensure memory management is correct (malloc/free), no leaks
- Write unit tests for core logic (add/delete/search/file I/O)

### Damian Wilson (UI + Core logic + Editor)
- Implement the calendar month grid UI (ASCII grid display for month/year)
- Review and edit Farah’s core logic functions (delete/search/file I/O) for clarity, bugs, and style consistency
- Help verify output formatting aligns with assignment requirements
- Ensure memory management is correct (malloc/free), no leaks
- Write unit tests for core logic (add/delete/search/file I/O)

### Sierra (Task Display UI)
- Implement “task printing UI” features:
  - Print tasks for a specific day
  - Print tasks for a month (compact view)
  - Print tasks for a year (compact view)
- Focus on readability + consistent formatting
