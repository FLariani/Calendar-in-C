# Calendar Application (C)

A console-based calendar and task management application written in C.
This project was developed for a college-level programming course and
demonstrates structured programming, dynamic memory allocation, linked
lists, and file I/O.

## Features
- Add tasks to specific dates
- Delete tasks by selecting a date and task ID
- Update a task description by selecting a date and task ID
- Search tasks by keyword (case-insensitive)
- Display a month calendar in a grid, marking days with tasks using `*`
- Print tasks for a specific day
- Print all tasks for a month (compact view)
- Print all tasks for a year (compact view)
- Save and load tasks from a text file (`tasks.txt`)
- Dynamic memory management (malloc/free) + linked lists for tasks

## File Storage
Tasks are stored in a simple readable format so it’s easy to debug/edit:

## Technologies Used
- C (ANSI C)
- Dynamic memory allocation (malloc/free)
- Linked lists (doubly linked lists)
- File I/O
- Visual Studio (Windows)

## File Structure
- `main.c` (or `calendar.c`) – core application logic
- `calendar.h` – structures and function declarations
- `tasks.txt` – saved task data
- `CalendarAppTests` – Native unit tests

## How to Run
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio
2. Build the project
3. Run the executable
4. Follow the on-screen menu

## Notes
- Tasks are stored in a human-readable text file.
- Task IDs are automatically managed by the program.

## Team Contributions

### Farah Lariani
- Implemented the core calendar data model using nested structs  
  (Year -> Month array -> Day array -> Task linked list)
- Led implementation of core functionality:
  - Adding tasks
  - Deleting tasks
  - Searching tasks by keyword
  - Saving and loading tasks from a text file
- Integrated all features into a menu-driven application
- Ensured correct use of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation throughout the project
- Wrote and coordinated unit testing for core logic and edge cases
- Acted as editor and integrator to ensure consistency across all components

### Damian Wilson
- Contributed to the initial struct formatting and helped shape the logical separation
  of task nodes per day within the calendar structure
- Implemented the task update functionality (editing an existing task’s description)
- Implemented and assisted with the memory cleanup / free-nodes logic
- Integrated all features into a menu-driven application
- Designed and refined the calendar grid UI for month and year views
- Wrote and coordinated unit testing for core logic and edge cases
- Reviewed and edited core logic implementations for clarity and structure
- Acted as editor and integrator to ensure consistency across all components

### Sierra Jamieson
- Implemented task-printing UI features:
  - Viewing tasks for a specific day
  - Compact month task view
  - Compact year task view
- Focused on readable, user-friendly output formatting
- Integrated all features into a menu-driven application
- Assisted with UI consistency and presentation
